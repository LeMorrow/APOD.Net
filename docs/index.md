# APOD.Net Documentation
APOD.Net is a .NET library used to asynchronously interface with [NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov#apod "Official API documentation - api.nasa.gov") (APOD). The API features a different image or photograph of our universe each day, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer. [Here's what today's picture looks like](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html "Astronomy Picture of the Day - apod.nasa.gov")!
